# TrafficLight
This traffic light prototype represents my first embedded systems project.


I have only posted the final solution of the project. The video how it works demonstrates the functionality of the traffic lights system.

You can see the launchpad LED glowing underneath the launchpad. It will be green whenever i push "walk button" (the middle switch sensor") and red 
whenever I push the other two buttons, which stands for the cars.
If I push the "west" car sensor(the one in the higher part of the protoboard) we will see the that the west greenlight comes on.
If I push the"south" car sensor(the one in the lower part of the protoboard) we will see that the south greenlight comes on.
If I push the "walk" sensor(the middle switch) we will see that the light on the launchpad comes green.
If we push all of them simultaneously , the green light will come on in turn.

I've completed this project with the help from "Embedded Systems - Shape The World: Microcontroller Input/Output" course (www.edx.org)
